Demo

The router challenge has returned this year. You can find the target device at your table.

The router has a low permission user pwn with default password rwctf, which is unchanged and you can access it via ssh.

For debugging purpose, root password in your device is empty. We will change root password and /etc/account1 file in the device for demo.

Demonstration requirements:

    Attack from LAN
    Get root shell of the router and show it
    Hijack the domain realworldctf.com to a webpage saying hacked by <your team name>

hint: The firmware is built on top of OpenWRT with customization: )

NOTE: Before you go on the stage, please make sure your debug information will not appear on the screen in case other teams see it.
