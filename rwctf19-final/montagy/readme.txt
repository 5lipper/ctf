Background:

Hi there, my agent said a smart guy ´_>` solved my challenge last year, which successfully caught my attention. | ᐕ)⁾⁾

But that was just a starter. You won't expect to 'win my heart' with only an appetizer would you?

This year I'll be serious about the challenge, and the gaming environment will (hopefully ( ‾◡‾)) be more robust and player-friendly.

Let me present you the next generation of smart contract proxy - MONica's TAG-based proxY - Montagy!

Try solve any of the puzzles and empty the proxy balance.

Enjoy!

Description:

    Web3 http provider to access the private chain (geth): http://172.16.27.100:8090/<md5(YOUR_TEAM_TOKEN)>/

    Target contract address: 0xd068fcc44525569fb593189c8f22827cf0f50f3f

    Once the balance of the target contract address equals 0, the backend will send the flagdata in a new tx

Info:

    genesis.json, player-privkey.txt and a sample docker(exactly the same except for flag, for debug only) are provided.

    Don't scan port 8090, there's no other api.

    Don't scan ports, there's no other open ports related to this challenge.

Hint:

An identical environment has been deployed on ropsten: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xd068fcc44525569fb593189c8f22827cf0f50f3f

But this is only to help you understand the situation, DON'T INTERACT WITH THIS ADDRESS during the contest.
